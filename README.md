# WeJapa-Labs
Labs completed under the WeJapa DS Remote Internship

Wave1: Worked on data types and operators in Python.

Wave2: Studied Python data structures.

Wave3: Learnt about control flow. This wave's labs was a collaborative one, it was shared among 6 other members of my team.

Wave4: This wave focuses on  functions and scripting in Python.

Wave5: Learnt about numpy and pandas

Capstone Project: This is a team project. We carried out an exploratory data analysis of the bikeshare data of three large US cities; Chicago, New York City and Washington.

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.

The aim of this analysis is to uncover bike share usage patterns and compare usage between the three cities.
